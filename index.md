### Research


#### Next-Generation Wireless Network Protocols

Future wireless networks will need to cope with rapidly increasing traffic and population of users. Increasing capacity of wireless networks involves improving spectrum efficiency, utilizing new frequency bands, and using advanced hardware and software techniques such as full-duplex communication and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). We are interested in designing protocols and algorithms that fully utilize the new hardware and techniques.

#### Machine-to-Machine Communications and Their Applications 

Nowadays everything is becoming “smart” mainly thanks to the networking technology. Devices communicate with other devices to do smart things, such as save energy in homes and detect hazards in factories. A large scale M2M network may consist of hundreds and thousands of devices communicating with each other to do collaborative work. They could be small devices with sensors, or large devices such as vehicles or drones. We are interested in designing reliable and energy-efficient protocols for data collection and data queries in large scale M2M networks, as well as application-oriented techniques for data fusion, such as distributed learning.

#### Localization and Recognition using Wireless Signals

Wireless signals carry information, but the signals themselves can become useful information to some applications. For example, it is possible to estimate location of a user by measuring signal strength of beacons received from nearby access points. With more advanced signal processing techniques, it is possible to recognize user movements or gestures using wireless signals. We are interested in developing techniques for highly accurate recognition of user positions and movements.

#### Robust Machine Learning Techniques for Security Applications

Attacks on networks and systems can be detected by machine learning techniques such as decision tree and neural networks. Known attacks can be recognized by detecting their signatures, but an unknown attack or a variation of a known attack is harder to catch. We use Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to find abnormal behavior in network frames and system parameters in order to find any new patterns that was not seen in normal conditions.
